      <h2>Description</h2>
      <div class="item1"><img src="./Interface.JPG" width="200" height="380">
      </div>
      <h4>Interface in public view chosen: Remote Control for TV</h4>The remote control interacts with the TV and
      controls what
      appears on it. The remote has various buttons, including
      the
      Power,
      Channel, Volume, Number, Directions, and Select buttons,
      which can be used to request various actions on the TV. Users can push certain buttons based on their needs:
      <li>Power button to turn the TV on/off</li>
      <li>Volume +/- buttons to increase/decrease the volume</li>
      <li>Channel ^/v buttons to move up/down the channel</li>
      <li>Number buttons to directly
        input channel numbers or insert alphabets to search for certain contents</li>
      <li>Directions/Select buttons to navigate through
        the screen and select items or contents</li><br>
      There are also various other buttons that are not frequently used as well.
      <br></br>
      The interface tries to solve
      the
      difficulty users might experience in controlling the TV and the inconvenience of some buttons. It aims to render
      all buttons self-explanatory, easy to use and find, intuitive, and straightforward. It places users' convenience
      in
      learning and using as its top priority.
      <br></br><br>
      <h2>Observations & Interview</h2>
      In order to understand the user interaction and experience with the chosen interface, I chose
      three different users to study and made objective observations about their interactions
      with the remote control. The chosen users are: User 1 (Dad), User 2 (Mom), User 3 (Grandmother).
      <br></br>
      <h3>Observations
      </h3>
      <li>None of the users had trouble turning on the TV using the the Power button on the remote. They were all
        able to change the volume easily as well.
      </li>
      <li>User 1, who is familiar with
        electronic goods, was able to change the volume and the channel without looking at the remote. However, the
        other
        users needed a quick look at the remote to
        locate the buttons before changing the volume and the channel.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 1 and User 2 tended to struggle with entering search words using the number-alphabet-matching buttons on
        the
        remote control. It took them more than 40 seconds on average to successfully type out a word in the search boxes
        on
        YouTube or
        Netflix. User 3 was not able to use this search functionality at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        When User 1 and User 2 tried to jump to a different spot in a video on Netflix or YouTube, it took them a long
        time
        as they had to make
        the progress/status bar of the video appear at the bottom and scroll through the bar until the desired point was
        reached. Alternatively, they often chose to fast-forward or rewind the video, depending on their needs. They
        either
        stared at the screen or played with their phones until it was done fast-forwarding. User 3 was not able to use
        this
        functionality
        at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 3 used the remote to watch only two TV channels. User 1 and User 2 used the remote mostly to
        navigate
        through Youtube and Netflix instead of the actual TV channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 3 frequently asked me or others for help with using the remote, asking why certain buttons/functionalities
        were not
        working as she intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        User 3 used only the Power/Volume/Channel buttons on the remote. User 1 and User 2 used the
        Directions/Select/Number buttons as well.
      </li>
      <br>
      <h3>Interview</h3>
      <h4>Questions</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>What are your expectations for the remote control interface?</li>
        <li>What is your experience with the remote control interface?</li>
        <li>What are your motives for using the remote control interface?</li>
        <li>Have you experienced any challenges or difficulties when using the remote control interface?</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Responses</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><B>User 1 (Dad):</B>
          <ul>
            <li>His expectations for the remote are that it makes it easy to change the volume
              and
              the channel, input alphabets, and move between different points
              in a video. He expects the remote to also have Directions/Select/Exit buttons
              and
              expects the
              buttons to be placed in locations that are easy to find and
              press.
            </li>
            <li>He says that the Power button is positioned
              at the
              very top and colored red, which is easy to find, the Volume and Channel buttons are very big and have
              bumps which
              make
              them easy to
              press, and the Directions/Select/Exit buttons are in convenient locations as well. </li>
            <li>However,
              he
              emphasizes
              the complete needlessness of the
              numerous buttons that are rarely used or have no use at all. He wishes that the remote would consist only
              of
              some
              important buttons and remove the rest to make
              the
              interface easier to learn and use through minimalism. </li>
            <li>Also, he points out the difficulty in inputting text and
              wishes the remote had a touch screen or a keyboard like the one on a BlackBerry phone. Also, he says that
              it
              is
              very
              difficult to navigate between different points in a video. </li>
            <li>He stresses that the most likely reason for
              this is
              that, although TV remotes were originally built to simply change the channel and the volume and not
              designed to
              search
              for videos or navigate through them, the modern use of TV has changed significantly. The changes
              involve
              using the TV to watch Netflix
              or
              YouTube besides the standard TV channels. Thus, the use and expectations for the remote have naturally
              changed
              as
              well to fit the users' changed needs. He wishes that the remote would be built in accordance with these
              changes
              to
              make typing keywords and navigating through videos easier.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li><b>User 2 (Mom):</b>
          <ul>
            <li>She says that the remote has a convenient design for turning the TV on/off and changing the volume and
              the channel.
              She says the important buttons, including the Number buttons, are easy to use as well.
            </li>
            <li>However, she
              acknowledges the difficulty in typing words using the number-alphabet matching buttons on the
              remote,
              which
              often stops her from watching Netflix or YouTube on TV. She also wishes that the remote was
              designed to
              enable her to conveniently select a point in the video she wishes to skip to, without having to move
              through
              the
              progress/status bar herself or fast-forward and rewind the video. </li>
            <li>She rates her overall experience with the
              interface as being
              positive, and her motives for using the remote are to control the TV when watching YouTube and Netflix.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li><b>User 3 (Grandmother):</b>
          <ul>
            <li>She states her motives for using the interface as to turn the TV on/off. </li>
            <li>Since she
              is unfamiliar with technological devices, she has experienced various challenges while using the
              remote.
              Moreover, the inconvenience of the buttons on the remote control and its user-unfriendliness have stopped
              her
              from watching TV. She no longer likes to watch TV because of the stress she gets from using the remote.
              She
              states that it is difficult and challenging to navigate through channels. She says
              it is fortunate that she uses it to watch only one or two certain daily news channels.
            </li>
            <li>Also, she
              has noticed that
              the remote is very easy to lose -- it is often easily hidden beneath a couch or a blanket, as
              the remote
              itself is too small and
              unremarkable. She says that keeping it in a designated location certainly helps for now but that some
              additional functionalities like location tracking would be very useful.
            </li>
            <li>
              She remarks that her overall experience with the
              interface is negative and that she would like it if the remote could be replaced either with a mobile app
              on the phone that can be connected to the TV or with a
              voice-recognizing system that she can talk to and make commands through.
            </li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <br>
        <li>
          The interface problems that Janet faces include the difficulty in typing out words by inputting alphabets
          using the buttons on the remote in order to search for a movie.
        </li>
        <li>She also experiences inconvenience
          in
          skipping directly to a different point in the movie without waiting for a long time or taking cumbersome extra
          steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          This persona represents the users of the chosen interface because the technologically advanced users of the
          remote
          control often watch YouTube or Netflix using the remote like Janet does.
        </li>
        <li>These users often experience difficulty in inputting
          text
          and navigating through different points in the movie easily, as shown in Janet's empathy map.
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <div class=""><img src="./John.png" width="900" height="550">
        </div>
        <br>
        <li>
          The interface problems that John faces include that there are too many buttons on the remote, most of which
          are
          never used. </li>
        <li>Some buttons, such as the number-alphabet-matching buttons, have tiny fonts, and some buttons are hard to
          locate.
        </li>
        <li>
          This persona represents the users of the chosen interface because the technologically less advanced users of
          the
          remote
          control often watch only one or two designated channels and do not explore other features, such as
          YouTube
          or Netflix, just like John. </li>
        <li>However, they might experience difficulties in using the remote if the buttons are not intuitive or
          easily learnable. They often ask for help using the remote, because its functionalities are not fully
          self-explanatory.
        </li>
        <br></br>
